1. DFA accept: I modified Dr. Lauter's code by implementing dictionaries
2. NFA to DFA: 
	Q became the power set of the original Q; 
	Sigma remained the same;
	Start state became all states the original start state could get to with e-transitions;
	Delta I closed the e-transitions and added all new substates from Q; 
	Accepting states became all substates of Q that contained the orginal accepting states;
	Lastly I removed all e-transitions.
3.NFA Union: 
	First I renamed any duplicate states.
	Q became the union of the two Qs, and the new start and accepting state;
	Sigma became the union of the two Sigmas;
	Start state was a new state with an e-transition to both starts;
	Delta was each delta connected to the new start and the new accepting state
	Accepting states were reached from previous accepting states
4.NFA Concat:
	First I rename any duplicate states.
	Q became the union of the two Qs;
	Sigma became the union of the two Sigmas;
	Start was start of first machine, accept from first machine transitioned to start of second machine and second machine accept was accept.
5.NFA Star:
	Q added a new start and new accept
	Sigma remained the same
	Delta added new start and accept and created new e-transitions from new start to old start and new accept, and from old accept to old start and new accept
6. Regex to NFA:
	I utilized a parsing code I found online to break the expression into tokens and then I used the tokens to build a delta function based on the letters and the operations.  I couldn't get it to work.
7. Bool Regex and string:
	I created a simple method that ran the expression and string through steps 6, 2, and 1.
	
For testing I created the include test suite.
